## To-dos:
1. Ways to show the table in the notebook
2. Necessary to provide estimation detail notebooks?
3. Check state dependence with Balint
4. slider for IRFs: Solving models under finer grids

## Acessing our jupyter notebook
To access our notebook, please follow steps below:
1.	Open a Windows command prompt or Mac command terminal and change into the folder you would like to store the files. 
    - You can do this using the command __cd__ in the command prompt.
