As illustrated by the left panel of Figure 5, idiosyncratic capital shocks have small but very persistent effects on the capital distribution. Since the robust investment rates are more sensitive to $R$ than those without robustness (see left panel of Figure 4), the persistence of $R$ is slightly reduced when the household is concerned about model misspecification. The dependence of $\\Phi_R$ on the initial capital distribution is very small. This follows from the fact that with homogeneous exposure to long run risk, the dynamics of $R$ and $Z$ are independent of each other. Among other things, this implies that (1) shock to the long run risk state does not affect $\\Phi_R$, and (2) the IRFs on the left panel of Figure 5 do not depend on $Z_0$.\n"
