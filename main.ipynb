    "We illustrate effects of concerns about robustness in three environments using a model of capital accumulation with adjustment costs proposed by [Eberly & Wang (2011)](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/nwang/papers/EberlyWang2011_04v3.pdf).

We focus on  effects of a positive one standard deviation shock to the second capital stock and evaluate $\\Phi_R$ at the median of the stationary distribution of $R$. As illustrated by the left panel of Figure 5, idiosyncratic capital shocks have small but very persistent effects on the capital distribution. Since the robust investment rates are more sensitive to $R$ than those without robustness (see left panel of Figure 4), the persistence of $R$ is slightly reduced when the household is concerned about model misspecification. The dependence of $\\Phi_R$ on the initial capital distribution is very small. This follows from the fact that with homogeneous exposure to long run risk, the dynamics of $R$ and $Z$ are independent of each other. Among other things, this implies that (1) shock to the long run risk state does not affect $\\Phi_R$, and (2) the IRFs on the left panel of Figure 5 do not depend on $Z_0$.\n"

The right panel of Figure 7 (accompanied with the right panel of Figure 5) illustrates how such beliefs affect the perceived impulse response of  the long-run risk state to an idiosyncratic capital shock: (1) for short horizons, the positive response appears *less* persistent than it is under the baseline model;  and (2) for longer horizons, the effect becomes negative temporarily."
